## Class Features

### Weapon and Armor Proficiency
Marshals are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of armor (heavy, medium, and light), and with shields (except tower shields).


## Auras
  60 foot range allies that can hear
    Unless otherwise noted, a marshal's aura affects all allies within 60 feet of including them self who can hear the marshal.
      An ally must have an Intelligence score of 3 or higher and be able to understand the marshal's language to gain the bonus.
    A marshal's aura is dismissed if they are dazed, unconscious, stunned, paralyzed, or otherwise unable to be heard or understood by there allies.
 
  The marshal exerts an effect on allies in there vicinity. They can learn to produce different effects, or auras, over the course of there career. The marshal may project one minor aura and one major aura starting at 2nd level at a time.

  Projecting an aura is a swift action. The aura remains in effect until the marshal uses a free action to dismiss it or activates another aura of the same kind (major or minor). A marshal can have an aura active continually; thus, an aura can be in effect at the start of a combat encounter even before the marshal takes there first turn.

  Activating an aura involves haranguing, ordering, directing, encouraging, cajoling, or calming allies. A marshal sizes up the enemy, allies, and the terrain, then gives allies the direction that they can use to do their best.


  A marshal begins play knowing one minor aura of there choice. As there marshal level increases, they gains access to new auras, as indicated on Table: The Marshal.

  All bonuses granted by a marshal's auras are circumstance bonuses that do not stack with each other.

### Minor Auras
A minor aura lets allies add the marshal's Charisma bonus (if any) to certain rolls.

###   Major Aura
Beginning at 2nd level, a marshal can project a major aura in addition to there minor aura.

A major aura lets allies add the Major Aura bonus.

### Skill Focus (Diplomacy)
Because a marshal has a way with people, he gains this feat as a bonus feat. If the marshal already has the feat, he can choose a different one.

### Grant Move Action (Ex)
Starting at 4th level, a marshal can direct and motivate there allies to act immediately.
Once per day, as a standard action, they may grant an extra move action to any or all of there allies within 30 feet (but not to themselves). 
Each of the affected allies takes this extra move action immediately, acting in their current initiative order. 
This extra action does not affect the allies' initiative count; the round continues normally after the marshal's turn is over. 
(This may mean, for example, that an ally whose initiative count immediately follows the marshal's may get an extra move action from the marshal, followed directly by a full round worth of actions on the ally's turn.)

A character can take only one extra move action per round. (In other words, two marshals can't use this ability on the same ally in the same round.) If an ally chooses not to take the extra move action, it is lost.


## Flavor Blerb
Sometimes it is not enough to be a conquering warrior, a champion of all that's right, an experienced sellsword, or an elite foot soldier. Sometimes the circumstances require a solid commander of soldiers and situations. Sometimes the circumstances demand a marshal.

Marshals inspire trust in those they lead. They earn that trust by slogging through harsh landscapes, dangerous battlefields, and haunted catacombs along with those under their command. With a look, they can see where to best deploy their resources or come up with a sneaky ruse to fool their enemies. A marshal has a tactician's mind, a cartographer's overview of the disputed landscape (or dungeon warren)
and a way with words that can inspire battle-hardened fighters to give it their all when melee breaks out.

Whether leading troops or a company of adventurers, marshals accept commissions in return for their service. Once a commission is accepted, most marshals feel honorbound to see the contract through to its end. If the choice is between honoring the commission and the survival of them company, though, many a marshal will break the commission and lead them forces to a new patron in distant lands.

Trained in the basics of fighting, marshals possess a general knowledge of weapons and armor. Their real strength is their ability to lead those who follow them to success they might not otherwise reach in combat. Marshals make passable warriors themselves, when personal danger finds them.

Marshals may be of any alignment. Good-aligned marshals are often crusading leaders who seek out and fight evil. Lawful-aligned marshals accept commissions from people who face invasion by foreign aggressors. Chaotic-aligned marshals lead mercenaries to wherever the pay is best. Evil-aligned marshals tend to lead forces of foreign aggressors set on invasion and plunder.

Marshals often worship Heironeous (god of valor) or Kord (god of strength). Some worship St. Cuthbert (god of retribution)
Hextor (god of tyranny)
or Erythnul (god of slaughter).

Marshals come to their profession through study and desire. Most have had formal training in a noble's army, where they were given positions of authority. Others have trained in formal academies, preparing themselves for careers as a military officers. Marshals see others of their class as part of a special group, especially those they have studied with. Even enemy marshals can be afforded some respect, though the enemy's forces must be crushed all the same.

Human marshals often follow in the footsteps of their parents, who served as officers in earlier wars, conflicts, or mercenary companies. Dwarf marshals are trained to lead strike teams that protect the underground dwarven kingdoms. Elf marshals rarely enroll in military academies, though half-elves often do. Half-orc marshals fight an uphill battle in trying to garner respect in mixed-race units. Among the brutal humanoids, few manage to enroll in the academies where the elite skills of command are taught.

The marshal relies on the other classes in all ways - it is them job to support a team, magnifying the strengths of each member for success in battles or forays into dangerous cavern complexes.

In most adventuring parties, the marshal serves as the lead tactician, while them comrades support there with spells, ranged attacks, and other effects. However, once a plan is in motion, most marshals enter the melee to assure victory.
